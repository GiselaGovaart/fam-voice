# Readme 

Most of the steps for the preprocessing of the EEG data are equal for paper 1 and paper 2. 
Steps that are specific to paper 1 are marked with "acq", whereas steps that are specific to paper 2 are marked with "rec" (or "recfam" for the exploratory analysis).

Please note that the speaker numbering in this GitHub repository differs from the speaker numbering in the papers:
