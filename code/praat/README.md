# Readme 

In this files, you can find the scripts used for the computation of mumDist, and the output. The input files for each mother are not shared, because we do not have the permission to do that. These audio files are available upon request for those mothers who consented to share them (n=66).

The table output/mean_of_means.Table contains the output: We computed the Mahalanobis distance  (for stimuli scaled on the ERB scale) of each mother’s instance to the corresponding vowel category of the experimental speakers and calculated an average distance for each mother’s two vowel categories compared to the vowel categories of the experimental speakers. We then averaged over the values for /ɪ/ and /ɛ/, resulting in one value for the average distance of the mother’s vowels to the corresponding speaker vowels. 

Note that vp 62 is only included in paper 2.

Please note that the speaker numbering in this GitHub repository differs from the speaker numbering in the papers:
