# Readme 

Please note that the speaker numbering in this GitHub repository differs from the speaker numbering in the papers:
Numbering GitHub          | Numbering papers                         
------------------------- | --------------------------------
Speaker 1                 | Speaker 1            
Speaker 2                 | Speaker 2           
Speaker 3                 | Speaker 4               
Speaker 4                 | Speaker 3          

Moreover, in paper 1, only the stimuli for Speaker 1, 2 and 4 (using the GitHub numbering) are used. Im paper 2, the stimuli for all speakers are used.

All calculations for the papers were done on the tables with the stimuli calculated in ERBs.
